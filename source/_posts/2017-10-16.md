AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN FIVE SHORT CHAPTERS
by Portia Nelson
<!-- more -->
I.
I walk down the street.
There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.
I fall in.
I am lost … 
I am helpless.
It isn't my fault.
It takes me forever to find a way out.
II.
I walk down the same street.
There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.
I pretend I don't see it.
I fall in again.
I can't believe I am in the same place.
But, it isn't my fault.It still takes a long time to get out.
III.
I walk down the same street.
There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.I see it is there.  
I still fall in … it's a habit.
My eyes are open.I know where I am.
It is my fault.I get out immediately.
IV.
I walk down the same street.
There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.
I walk around it.
V.
I walk down another street.
