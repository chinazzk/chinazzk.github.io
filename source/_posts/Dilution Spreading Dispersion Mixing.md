##### Dilution Spreading Mixing

The concepts of mixing of two species and of dilution of one species should be distinguished from that of spreading.

Spreading, which has been the subject of macro-dispersion studies, is a macro-scale phenomenon, which describes the spatial extent of the concentration field, primarily controlled by aquifer heterogeneities [[*Gelhar and Axness*, 1983](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2006WR005658/full#wrcr11156-bib-0016); [*Neuman et al.*, 1987](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2006WR005658/full#wrcr11156-bib-0030); [*Dagan*, 1988](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2006WR005658/full#wrcr11156-bib-0007)].

Dilution and mixing process is ultimately controlled by local dispersive transport. [[*Kitanidis*, 1994](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2006WR005658/full#wrcr11156-bib-0025)]presented a “dilution index”, which quantitatively distinguishes between spreading and dilution [[*Kapoor and Kitanidis*, 1996](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2006WR005658/full#wrcr11156-bib-0020), [1998](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2006WR005658/full#wrcr11156-bib-0021)].

Although the macro-dispersion coefficients describe spreading of solute plumes, it is well known that they overestimate mixing. There have been many studies showing that the so-called effective dispersion theory that takes into account finite-size solute plumes more accurately models mixing.

To be a real PHD ! no more wasting time on other things!
